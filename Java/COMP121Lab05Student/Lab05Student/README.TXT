GRADE NOW: yes

1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?

I needed to test every method in the ApplianceAdapter class.
Those methods are as follows:

ApplianceAdapter(Appliance app) - constructor
getDescription()            setDescription(String desc)
getId()                     setId(String id)
getWeeklyRate()             setWeeklyRate(Money wklyRt)
calculateFee(int weeks)     isRented()
returned()                  rented()

I also had to test the methods in the ABCRentals class to
be sure the adapter would work properly with the inventory
system.

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?
    
I did not "not anticipate" anything. I did, however, struggle a bit 
at first until I saw how the Appliance object could be adapted to an
Item object. I also struggled with understanding the validation of 
the Appliance fields. Once I understood the logic this was not that 
difficult. 

Very useful design pattern!
	
3.  What would you do differently next time?

Nothing! I am very proud of this work. I did my best and I think it shows.
