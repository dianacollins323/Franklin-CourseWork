								JavaScript was designed as a language to use with the DOM in 
								browsers, which, as in any graphical user interface environment, 
								entails dealing with events. What language features are included 
								in JavaScript to support writing event handlers, and how do they 
								make writing event handlers easier than in a language such as 
								Java or C++?
							</p>
							<p>
								Because JavaScript was designed to be used with the DOM it 
								was designed to handle events associated with the GUI. If 
								the mouse is moved, that is an event. If the page loads, 
								that is an event. Java and C++ events must be defined, but
								these events are already defined for use in JavaScript.

								What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript's 
								prototype-based object system compared to a class-based object 
								system, particularly with regard to JavaScript's normal place as a 
								scripting language for web pages?
							</p>
							<p>
								Greater flexibility is the greatest advantage of JavaScript's 
								prototype-based object system. Rather than having a fixed class
								that is set at compile time, you have the ability to manipulate 
								and dynamically use and change the class at run time. This 
								makes JavaScript a good language for programming web pages as
								many clients want their pages to be more interactive with the user.
