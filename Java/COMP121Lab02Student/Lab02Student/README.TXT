GRADE NOW: yes

1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?

The AbstractItem class needs test cases for all of the member variable set method validations and the equals method. 

The Furniture and Television classes need further test classes for their special member variable validations and equals methods.

The ItemLookup and TVLookup classes both need tests for their matches methods.

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?

I ran into much difficulty when implementing the abstract class and sub classes. Further study is required. I also didn't expect the validations to be as challenging as they were. Time allocation was only a problem because of being out of town over the weekend for the OCWIC conference.
	
3.  What would you do differently next time?

I plan to begin the lab as soon as I download it next time. I think that if I begin it early I will have more time to run into these problems and will be able to ask more questions during lecture rather than becoming stressed and having to play email tag.
