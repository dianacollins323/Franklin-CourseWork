GRADE NOW: yes

1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?

In the ABCRentals class I implemented processOrder() and created 
several helper methods. All of these methods needed tested. 
They are as follows:
- processBackOrder()          - orderInStock()
- handleOrder()               - checkBackOrders()
- getBackOrders()             - sortBackOrders()

In the Order class I had to implement all methods and I also created
one helper method, compareTo() which had to be overridden when I 
implemented the Comparable interface. I tested all of the methods
including the compareTo() method.

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?
    
I did not anticipate having to create so many helper methods. I probably 
could have combined some of them, but I think it is better to have each
action separate and have more methods.
	
3.  What would you do differently next time?

I am very proud of this lab. I'm not sure I would do anything differently, 
though I'm sure as I learn more I will think of ways to improve my work.
