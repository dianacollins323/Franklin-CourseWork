Questions
</h2>
<p class="firstLine">
How does the Perl mechanism(s) for printing output compare in terms of
    ease-of-use, flexibility, power, or other criteria to the mechanism in another language
    you are familiar with?</p>
<p>
Compared to JavaScript and XSLT, Perl is much easier to work with in
    regards to writing to an html file. There is no need to create an element, as there is
    in JavaScript, you simpily specify the file to print to and quote the tag. Because it
    is easier to use, especilly with the XML::LibXML module, fewer lines of code are required.</p>
<p class="firstLine">
Choose a Perl feature (other than print features) that you used or one
    that looked intriguing but you were not able to find a use for. Describe that feature
    briefly and discuss how it is an improvement over the corresponding feature in another
    language that you know.</p>
<p>
Perl has a feature called pragma. A pragma is a module that can be used
    to affect the program in some way. You can use modules that already exist or create 
    one. I used the strict pragma which forced me to declare all of my variables. It also 
    help with error detection early on which in turn help the programmer to develop better
    code.</p>
