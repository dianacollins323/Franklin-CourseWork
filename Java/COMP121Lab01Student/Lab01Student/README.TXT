GRADE NOW: Yes

1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?

I didn't know that order mattered. I think a review of this criteria would benefit many in  my class, as well as me.




2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?

I did not anticipate having a problem uploading my program to WebCAT for grading. 

I didn't think using ArrayLists would be a problem. After the lab review lecture and learning that I was not permitted to use them I had to rework some of my code. This helped  to improve my score, but I would have like to know that from the beginning.

I also did not expect to have such difficulty writing test cases. After submitting the program I found my test and code were lacking greatly. I brought grade up significantly, but still had trouble figuring out what I was missing. I look forward to finding out.

	
3.  What would you do differently next time?

I would start by reviewing the program and taking more nots. While I began that way this time, I think I could have spent more time on this step and maybe worked more things out ahead of time. I might also ask more questions ahead of time so that I'm not redoing things at the end, like replacing ArrayLists with arrays.
