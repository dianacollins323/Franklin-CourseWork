         Is XSLT a programming language?" Give your rationale. Note that
         an answer to the effect that XSLT doesn't allow general computation is
         not valid. In fact, XSLT has been demonstrated to be Turing complete.
         Instead, focus on the way you have to think about coding in XSLT.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Yes, XSLT is a programming language. It is a text based language that 
         matches patterns. I had difficulty fully understanding how to use XSLT, 
         but with more time I'm confident it would be come clear.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         What are the fundamental ways in which XSLT differs from the Java
         programming language?
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The way XSLT code is implemented. It uses tages to identify elements 
         rather than variable assignments.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         What are the primary abstractions supported by the XSLT language?
         
      </p>
      <p>
         XSLT transforms xml documents into new xml documents, html, and plain text.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         What is the underlying procedure implemented by the XSLT proces-
         sor? That is, at a high level of description, what occurs when the
         processor is presented with XSLT and XML documents?
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The XSLT document is read, and the XML document it transformed into a new 
         document according to the direction specified in the XSLT document.
